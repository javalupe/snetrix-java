A snake and tetris crossover!

![gameplay](project/assets/gameplay.gif)


## Gameplay

To earn points, the player must guide the snake to eat colorful pellets so as
to form the shapes indicated on the sidebar in the right color. When a shape is
successfully formed using the snake's body, it disappears! That earns the
player a few points, as well as a shorter and more maneuverable snake.

A snake and tetris crossover!

To earn points, the player must guide the snake to eat colorful pellets so as
to form the shapes indicated on the sidebar in the right color. When a shape is
successfully formed using the snake's body, it disappears! That earns the
player a few points, as well as a shorter and more maneuverable snake.

This game was made as our final project for the Object Oriented Programming
course in our university, so the code and the documentation are written in our
native language, Brazilian Portuguese.
